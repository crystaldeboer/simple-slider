                <p class="quote">"I really thought I was stuck between a rock and a hard place after I graduated college with a liberal arts degree and needed more schooling—and scholarships—in order to get a decent job. My life has completely changed! All of my friends and family are so impressed, and it has brought a certain kind of confidence in my abilities not only as a "techie" but as a mom, and person in general that I could switch careers and understand and DO it. You really can't put a price on that."</p>
